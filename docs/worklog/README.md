# Work Logs

This directory contains daily work logs tracking progress, decisions, blockers, and context for the iRO-Wiki-Scraper project.

## Purpose

Work logs serve as:

1. **Progress tracking**: Record what was accomplished each session
2. **Decision log**: Document choices made and rationale
3. **Context preservation**: Help resume work after interruptions
4. **Communication**: Share status with team
5. **Historical record**: Understand project evolution

## Naming Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD_NN_brief_description.md
```

Examples:
- `2026-01-23_01_initial_setup.md`
- `2026-01-23_02_api_client_implementation.md`
- `2026-01-24_01_database_schema_testing.md`

The `NN` counter resets to `01` each day.

## Document Structure

Each work log should include:

```markdown
# Work Log - [Brief Description]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Session**: NN
**Duration**: [Time spent]
**Status**: [In Progress | Completed | Blocked]

## Summary

One-paragraph overview of what was worked on.

## Accomplishments

- Specific task completed
- Another task completed
- Feature implemented

## Decisions Made

- **Decision**: What was decided
  - **Rationale**: Why this choice was made
  - **Alternatives**: What else was considered

## Blockers

- Issue encountered that needs resolution
- Dependency waiting on external input

## Next Steps

1. First priority task
2. Second priority task
3. Follow-up items

## Notes

Additional context, links, or observations.

## Time Breakdown

- Task A: 1.5 hours
- Task B: 2 hours
- Debugging: 0.5 hours
- Total: 4 hours
```

## When to Create

Create a work log entry when:
- Starting a significant work session
- Completing a major milestone
- Before context switching (end of day, switching tasks)
- When making important decisions
- Encountering blockers or challenges

You may have multiple entries per day for different work sessions.

## Best Practices

1. **Write immediately**: Log while context is fresh
2. **Be specific**: Include commit hashes, file names, functions
3. **Record decisions**: Explain why, not just what
4. **Track time**: Helps estimate future work
5. **Note blockers**: Document issues for follow-up
6. **Link artifacts**: Reference commits, PRs, design docs
7. **Keep it brief**: Focus on key points, not exhaustive detail

## Status Values

- **In Progress**: Work ongoing, more to do
- **Completed**: Work finished, ready for review or next step
- **Blocked**: Cannot proceed due to dependency or issue
